### 🧸 The Kidult See-Saw | 

**#MakeoverMonday 2025 Week 38** 

*Description*:
This Tableau visualization explores how different age groups in Britain perceive “childlike” activities — from stuffed animals and cartoons to Star Wars, board games, and Dungeons & Dragons. Using a see-saw metaphor, the viz illustrates how opinions tilt between childish and adult across generations.

*Key Insights*:

Younger adults (18–34) are more open to playful, nostalgic hobbies.

Middle-aged groups (35–49, 50–64) tend to view more activities as “for kids.”

Older adults (65+) show surprising fondness for fandoms like Star Wars, Doctor Who, and Lord of the Rings.

Hobbies like sweets, birthday presents, and board games are ageless joys shared across generations.

*Design Approach*:

Built in Tableau using dual-axis see-saws for each category.

The 50% baseline represents the neutral midpoint — a balance between childlike and adult perceptions.

Values below the baseline (e.g., 65%) lean more toward “childish,” while values above (e.g., 30–40%) indicate a stronger “adult” association.

Dashboard layout is designed to be playful yet structured — mirroring the balance theme of the visualization.
