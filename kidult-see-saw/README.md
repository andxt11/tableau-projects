### 🧸 The Kidult See-Saw | 

#MakeoverMonday 2025 Week 38 

Description:
This Tableau visualization explores how different age groups in Britain perceive “childlike” activities — from stuffed animals and cartoons to Star Wars, board games, and Dungeons & Dragons. Using a see-saw metaphor, the viz illustrates how opinions tilt between childish and adult across generations.

Key Insights:

Younger adults (18–34) are more open to playful, nostalgic hobbies.

Middle-aged groups (35–49, 50–64) tend to view more activities as “for kids.”

Older adults (65+) show surprising fondness for fandoms like Star Wars, Doctor Who, and Lord of the Rings.

Hobbies like sweets, birthday presents, and board games are ageless joys shared across generations.

Design Approach:

Built in Tableau using dual-axis see-saws for each category.

X-axis (0 to 1) represents the balance between child and adult perceptions.

Dashboard layout: playful yet balanced — echoing the theme of generational contrasts.
